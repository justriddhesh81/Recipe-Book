            <h1>Pappu Charu</h1>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>

<p>
    1 cup Arhar dal (Split Toor Dal) <br>
3 Green Chillies , or red dry chillies<br>
10 cloves Garlic<br>
1 Tomato , chopped<br>
1 Onion , chopped<br>
2 tablespoons Tamarind Paste<br>
1/2 teaspoon Turmeric powder (Haldi)<br>
Salt , to taste<br>
For Tempering<br>
2 tablespoons Ghee<br>
6 Curry leaves<br>
1 teaspoons Mustard seeds (Rai/ Kadugu)<br>
1 pinch Asafoetida (hing)<br>
</p>


<h2>Preparation</h2>
To begin making the Andhra Style Pappu Chaaru, first wash the dal thoroughly and soak it for 15 to 20 minutes.<br>

Add the dal, chopped tomatoes, chopped onion, green chillies, 6 crushed garlic cloves, turmeric powder and 2 cups of water into a pressure cooker.
<br>
Place the pressure cooker on a high heat and allow it to cook. When you hear a couple of whistles, turn the heat to low and continue to cook for a couple more whistles. The dal should be cooked well enough to be mashed easily. After 4-5 whistles in all, turn the heat off and allow the pressure to release naturally.
<br>
When you are able to lift the weight easily and open the lid of the pressure cooker, mash the cooked dal well using a vegetable masher.<br>

Add tamarind pulp, salt and the remaining crushed garlic to this and 1 cup water and boil it again till the raw tamarind smell vanishes and the dal thickens.<br>

Taste the dal and adjust salt and tamarind levels if needed. The chaaru should be tangy, spicy and garlicy.
<br>
For tempering, place a tadka ladle on the heat. Add some gheeand warm it up. Add the mustard seeds and allow them to crackle.<br>

Next, add asafoetida and curry leaves and allow them to splutter and crisp up. Pour the tempering over the chaaru and serve with Steamed Rice and a dollop of ghee.
